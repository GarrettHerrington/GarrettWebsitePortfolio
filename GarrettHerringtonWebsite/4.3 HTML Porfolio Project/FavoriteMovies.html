<h1>Garrett's Movie List</h1>
<h2>Here are my top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Thing</h3>
<p>
  The thing is my favorite Sci-Fi horror film of all time. Stunning performance
  by Kurt Russel, impeccable writing, <br />and well done conventional special
  effects make this movie a must see.
</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>
  A controversial film that offers a lot of thought provoking ideas. Starring
  Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, <br />Fight Club is a zeigtgeist that captures
  the psyche of many information age, middle class men. <br />The writing is
  impeccable and Brad Pitt as well as Edward Norton give dedicated performances.
</p>
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>
  My favorite Miyazaki film. Princess Mononoke is a fairy tale in which
  fantastical spirits and beasts bid for control of the land.<br />
  The themes of the film are thought provoking and the story will leave you
  wanting more.
