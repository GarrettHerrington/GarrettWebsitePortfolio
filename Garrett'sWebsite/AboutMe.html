    <h1>Hey! I'm Garrett!</h1>

    <p>
      Hello! I'm Garrett, I am studying computer science at Belhaven University.
      I have a son named Emmett who is a good boy that I love with all my heart.
      My journey to becoming a software engineer has been long and
      untraditional. Always having had a deep interest in computers even as a
      child seeing my brothers and sisters get on the family pc to play floppy
      disc games and use AOL Instant messanger I was always trying to use the
      computer. I was discouraged at a young age from pursuing this interest
      though due to it simply being "playing with electrons". After a misguided
      attempt at getting my Biology degree at USM, I joined the Navy where I
      began to really think about what I wanted to do in life (Staying in the
      Navy was out of the question). Then I spoke to one of my best friends at
      USM who'd graduated with his computer science degree in 2015 and he
      suggested I pursue my degree in computer science. I thought it was a swell
      idea and here I am today.
